                Project Overview
            </p>

            <div class="text">
                This project is part of the User Experience course taught by Professor Chris Nappi. It involved designing a take-out app for Pete's Little Lunch Box, a popular food truck near Drexel University. Known for its quick, customizable meals but lacking branding, Pete's was an ideal candidate for a digital makeover. Through collaborative efforts, our team utilized user research, wireframing, prototyping, and usability testing to create an app that reflected Pete's charm and practicality while addressing user needs and aligning with its values.

            <div class="text">
                We chose Pete's Little Lunch Box for its strong community presence and charm, aiming to translate this into a mobile app. Despite a small menu, their customizable options created a deceptively long list, challenging us to simplify it without overwhelming users. Additionally, balancing our team's workload and schedules proved difficult, but through communication and efficient use of class time, we collaborated effectively to deliver a comprehensive app.            </div>

                To kickstart the project, we initiated a Fly on the Wall exercise, where each team member observed customers interacting with the food truck at different times of the day. In addition, we conducted interviews with Pete's customers to gain deeper insights into their needs and pain points.

                <li>While waiting, customers typically engage with phones, chat with companions, or stand quietly</li>

                During our User Research Interviews, we also conducted competitive research on existing food truck apps in the market. Additionally, we took an in-depth look at the mobile food ordering process to find inspiration and examples of intuitive and streamlined workflows. Below is our funtional audit from existing apps that we did research on:

Our goal was to evoke a comforting feel through the color palette while retaining the red from Pete's original branding. We also incorporated a lunchbox icon and other signature elements to stay true to Pete's established brand identity.

                    <li>Icons on the navigation bar were unclear and difficult to interpret. For instance, the menu button resembled a file cabinet in the initial two designs.</li>
                    <li>Critical information, such as the food truck's hours and location, was hidden under a dropdown menu, making it less accessible to users.</li>

                <strong>Solution</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Users can now control the carousel at their own pace, and clicking on it directs them to the menu screen.</li>
                    <li>Updated the menu icon to make it more recognizable, added labels to all icons for better clarity and accessibility.</li>

                    <li>The existing loyalty program's point system design was ambiguous, leading to user confusion and frustration.
                    </li>
                    <li>Users mentioned the point system resembled a switch or reminded them of "Burger King," which caused confusion about its purpose.</li>
                    <li>The overall reward system lacked clarity. Users struggled to understand how points were earned, accumulated, and ultimately redeemed for rewards. This lack of transparency led to frustration and disengagement with the program.</li>

            <p class="big-title">Takeaways</p>

            <p class="text">
                This project was a formative experience, combining our ideas into functional prototypes. Our redesigned app bridges the gap for Pete's Little Lunch Box by offering a streamlined menu and ordering system, making it more accessible to a larger community. Given more time, we'd enhance the menu and checkout flows for better user exploration and add a settings feature for light/dark mode. We also plan to include an option to contact the food truck for customer concerns.
            </p>

            <p class="text">Collaboration this term was a journey. Despite scheduling challenges due to extracurricular commitments, we effectively communicated via Discord to complete the project. Working through these difficulties allowed us to deliver a great final product.           
            </p>

            <p class="text">The project was an invaluable opportunity to engage in an end-to-end design process. Through multiple iterations and user testing, we learned to incorporate feedback and continuously improve. Group critiques were also essential in refining the app, ensuring we received diverse insights.
            </p>

            <p class="text">Ultimately, this project deepened our understanding of UX principles. Using tools like Figma, FigJam, and Figma Slides, we applied key concepts from lectures, such as avoiding overwhelming users with too many navigation options. This focus improved usability, making our app smoother and easier to navigate.
