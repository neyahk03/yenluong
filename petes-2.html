                In a previous course, we were tasked to design a functioning Figma prototype for a food truck app. We took this project further by refining the design and developing a functional and dynamic app through repetitive user research and testing.

            <div class="text">
                Though Pete's menu initially appeared extensive, it was actually quite small—the illusion of length came from the many customization options displayed at a glance. This presented a unique challenge, as we needed to streamline the menu in a way that maintained its variety without overwhelming users.
                Additionally, the business lacked a social media presence or branding beyond the truck itself, which featured a red, white, and black color scheme. This gave us creative freedom but also solidified red as the dominant color in our design. Red proved to be both a challenge and an asset—its bold presence made a strong visual impact, yet required thoughtful application to avoid overwhelming the branding. In the end, it became a defining element of Pete's identity, striking a balance between vibrancy and usability.            </div>

                Although the project lasted for 10 weeks with three main stages—Alpha, Beta, and Final—I primarily focused on backend development, so my personal timeline consisted of three key stages:

                        <strong>Getting Started</strong> -  In this initial phase, I focused on setting up the worksheet and database, laying the groundwork for data storage and retrieval. This step was crucial in ensuring a structured and scalable foundation for the web app.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Alpha Phase</strong> - During this phase, I developed the static pages using only HTML and CSS, translating the Figma prototype into a live webpage. The goal was to accurately bring the visual design to life while maintaining responsiveness and accessibility.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Final Phase (Backend Integration)</strong> - This stage involved integrating PHP and SQL into the project, making the web app interactive. I worked on features like handling user input, managing the cart, storing order details, and ensuring seamless database connectivity to create a functional and dynamic user experience.

            <div class="text">
                Before starting the prototype, I collaborated with the team's data architecture to clean and structure Pete's menu in a well-organized spreadsheet. I then built a MySQL database, ensuring all necessary tables were set up for seamless integration into the project. To enhance user experience and minimize redundancy, we streamlined the menu by consolidating similar items. For example, instead of listing 10 separate breakfast sandwiches, we combined them into a single customizable option, allowing users to select their preferred bread, protein, and condiments. This approach made the menu more intuitive and easier to navigate.

            <div class="text">
                With the database in place, I implemented a PHP script to dynamically fetch menu data, ensuring smooth integration with the front end. Using prepared statements for security, the script queries both the main menu tables and customizable ingredient tables based on user-provided GET parameters. The retrieved data is stored in associative arrays, enabling efficient processing and seamless display within the app.

                After setting up the database, I began by developing a static webpage using only HTML and CSS. This phase involved translating the Figma prototype created by the design team into a functional layout. While most interactive features were not yet implemented, this step allowed us to map out the key functionalities and microinteractions we wanted to prioritize as we continued developing the project.

            <div class="text">
                Since our design team chose "Continue as Guest" as the primary user flow, I implemented PHP sessions to track guest users and their cart items without requiring an account. When a user selects the guest option, the system assigns a unique guest ID, initializes an empty cart, and sets up an order tracking array. This alows users to browse, add items to their cart, and place orders.

                    To dynamically display menu items on the menu screen, I implemented a PHP script that retrieves data from the database across multiple categories, including sandwiches, cheesesteaks, salads, pastries, and drinks. A PHP foreach loop iterates through the retrieved results, generating interactive menu elements, each displayed as a clickable link that directs users to its detailed page.

                    The subtotal section dynamically updates using JavaScript whenever users select customization options or change the quantity. The script calculates the total by summing the base price and any additional customization costs, then multiplies it by the selected quantity. This ensures that the displayed price instantly reflects any changes. The updated subtotal is sent to the cart when the user clicks the "Add to Bag" button.

            <div class="text">
                To handle the "Add to Bag" functionality, I used the POST method to retrieve form data, ensuring all selected options are properly captured. The script extracts key details such as the item ID, main table, image, menu item name, price, subtotal, notes, and quantity. It also processes customization options, differentiating between checkbox selections (multiple choices) and radio button selections (single choice) while filtering out unnecessary values. This structured approach ensures accurate data transfer to the bag for users to review their order.

            <div class="text">
                To efficiently manage the cart, I implemented logic to check if an item with the same ID, table, menu item, customizations, and notes already exists in the cart. If found, it simply increases the quantity and updates the subtotal. Otherwise, the item is added as a new entry. Customizations are sorted for consistency, ensuring that variations in selection order don't create duplicate entries. This approach keeps the cart organized and prevents unnecessary duplicates.
            </div>

            <div class="text">
                This is also where I initialize the data stored in <strong>$_SESSION['cart']</strong> , ensuring that each item includes essential details such as id, table name, title, price, quantity, subtotal, and selected customizations. This structured approach allows for efficient retrieval, modification, and display of cart items throughout the web app.

                To ensure the subtotal is calculated correctly, I use the <strong>array_sum</strong>  function combined with <strong>array_column</strong> , which extracts the subtotal values from all cart items in <strong>$_SESSION['cart']</strong>  and sums them up. This ensures the total displayed in the cart dynamically reflects all selected items and their quantities. The result is formatted using  <strong>number_format</strong> for a consistent currency display.

            <div class="text">
                Each item added to <strong>$_SESSION['cart']</strong> (which is cart) is assigned a unique index number, storing all relevant data, including the table name, title, price, and selected customizations. To allow users to modify their selections, I added an edit button that links to the item's edit screen, passing its index number in the URL.
            </div>

            <div class="text">
                
                To handle the editing process, I created an edit.php file that retrieves the item details from the cart using the index number passed in the URL. The script fetches the item data from the session and pre-fills the form with the current selections, allowing users to modify their choices.

                When users finalize their updates and click the Update button, their changes are sent to update_cart.php, where the script processes the request efficiently. First, it validates that the cart exists in the session and ensures that the submitted item index is valid. It then retrieves the updated data, including quantity, notes, and customizations, while preserving the existing structure and filtering out unnecessary price-related keys. To prevent duplicate entries, the script checks if another item in the cart has the same item ID, table, name, and customizations. If a match is found, it merges the quantities and recalculates the subtotal instead of adding a duplicate item. Once the updates are applied, the script ensures that the item's data is correctly stored in <strong>$_SESSION['cart']</strong>. If a duplicate was merged, the original entry is removed, and the array is re-indexed for consistency. Finally, the user is redirected back to the cart page (bag.php), ensuring a smooth and organized update process.

                    For the Delete Item functionality, I created a form that sends the item's index to remove_item.php when the user clicks the delete button. The remove_item.php script runs entirely on the backend to ensure a seamless user experience. It first verifies that the session is active and checks if the index value exists in the request. If a valid index is provided, the corresponding item is removed from $_SESSION['cart']. To maintain a structured cart, the array is re-indexed using array_values(), ensuring no gaps in the item list. Since this process happens in the background, the user remains unaware of the backend operation, experiencing only the immediate removal of the item from their cart upon interaction. After the item is deleted, the user is redirected back to the cart page (bag.php), maintaining a smooth and uninterrupted shopping experience.

                    To allow users to clear their entire cart, I implemented a simple reset function using unset($_SESSION['cart']). When the user clicks the "Clear Bag" button, the request is sent to a backend script that starts the session and removes the cart data from $_SESSION. This instantly resets the cart to an empty state.

            <div class="text">
                <strong>Payment Method</strong>
                <p> The payment method selection is an essential step, implemented using JavaScript to dynamically update the UI based on user choices. When users click on the "Choose Payment" box, they are directed to the payment selection screen, where they can choose from Google Pay, Apple Pay, Venmo, or Cash on Pickup. The script listens for the selection, stores the choice using <strong>localStorage.setItem()</strong> , and then updates the UI accordingly.

                At this stage, I wanted to transfer the cart details into a dedicated session for the order summary. To achieve this, I created a new <strong>$_SESSION['order']</strong>  array that stores the order number, items, subtotal, total price, tax, tip, and pickup time. The pickup time defaults to "ASAP" unless the user selects a specific time. I also reset the <strong>$_SESSION['cart']</strong> after transferring the data to the order session. This ensures that when the user returns to the menu, they can add new items without any interference from their previous order.

Pulling this information directly from the session ensures the user sees the most up-to-date details of their order without requiring additional database queries.
