            <div>
                This case study highlights the development of a recipe website using PHP, focusing on creating a dynamic, data-driven platform that integrates a MySQL database to retrieve and display recipes. The project aligns with the goals of the course, which emphasizes server-side programming, handling user input, managing databases, and implementing key features such as user authentication and dynamic content retrieval. The website aims to simplify recipe browsing by offering search and filter functionalities, providing users with an intuitive and interactive experience.

        <div class="text">
            This is an independent project assigned as a practical exercise to deepen understanding of server-side scripting (PHP) and how it integrates with client-side technologies. The project also introduced database management concepts through phpMyAdmin, culminating in a functional, data-driven web application.

        <div class="text">
            The challenge was to design and develop a fully functional recipe website that dynamically loads data from a database while providing users with an engaging and intuitive experience for browsing and filtering recipes.

            Alpha Phase
        </p>

        <div class="text">
            I started with branding by selecting a logo that I found visually appealing and building the website's design around it. From there, I developed a cohesive color palette and design aesthetic. Once the design foundation was set, I built the initial static version of the website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring it was responsive and visually appealing.
        </div>

        <p class="medium-title">
            Beta Phase
        </p>

        <div class="text">
            During this phase, I transitioned the static pages into dynamic ones using PHP, enabling the website to deliver personalized and interactive content. I established database connections with MySQL to store and retrieve recipe data efficiently, leveraging phpMyAdmin to design and manage a well-structured database. This database holds all the recipe details, including titles, subtitles, descriptions, ingredients, protein type, cuisine, cook time, and images.
        </div>

            </div>
            
        </div>

        <div class="text">
            Then I implemented a robust search and filter functionality. Users can search for recipes using keywords that are dynamically matched across multiple fields, such as ingredients, and cuisine, or apply filters to narrow down results based on specific criteria like protein type. The system uses prepared statements to ensure secure and efficient querying of the database, preventing SQL injection vulnerabilities.

        </div>

        <div class="text">
        To display all recipes or those filtered by the user's keyword, I used a foreach loop to iterate through the results retrieved from the database and dynamically render them on the webpage. Each recipe displays its image, title, and a link directing users to a detailed page for that specific recipe

        </div>

        <div class="text">
            For the recipe's detail page, I also used PHP to retrieve data from the database and display it dynamically on the page. To present the instructions step-by-step, I utilized the explode function to break the instruction string into individual steps and display them sequentially.

            The recipe page displays 40 recipes and includes a search bar and a protein filter.

I also added a "Clear Filter" button, which resets the filters and restores the full list of recipes. Each recipe card includes a clickable link that redirects users to its detailed page.

        <div class="text">
            Throughout this project, I gained valuable experience in PHP and database integration. The project successfully met its objectives:

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Functionality:</strong> Achieved seamless data retrieval and dynamic content display.</li>
                <li><strong>User Experience:</strong> Positive feedback highlighted the intuitive design and effective filtering system.</li>
                <li><strong>Skills Development:</strong> Improved proficiency in server-side programming and database management.</li>
            </ul>

            The iterative process allowed me to refine the website's functionality and design. If given more time, I would implement additional features, such as filtering recipes by cook time, servings, or calories, to further enhance user experience.
